## Med Supply Ordering System

### A few thoughts in my head about flow

### As a user I can place an order for the Product I need
 - User comes to Med Supply Plus website
 - User searches for Product
 - List of Product displayed (Price low to high)
 - User selects Product
 - Product is added to Basket
 - User navigates to Basket ready for checkout
 - User double checks Product
 - User enters billing info and shipping info
 - User places order for Product
